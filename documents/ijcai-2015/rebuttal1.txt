Our approach adapts itself to specific objects and does not generalize
to new objects.  Learning and then mastering individual objects forms
an enabling capability for robotic object manipulation, because a
robot can improve its capability "in the wild" to manipulate the
object that an untrained user cares about.

Finding a good prior is equivalent to the problem of performing
category-based grasping.  If the prior is perfect (i.e, category-based
grasping is solved), then our method will quickly terminate
