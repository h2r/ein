We thank the reviewer for their comments.  

"Do you have to learn one for each object?"

We learn a separate model for each object.  Learning and then
mastering individual objects enables a robot to improve its capability
to manipulate the objects through practice.

"For instance, if the prior is very optimistic, the learning process
could be very different than if the prior is pessimistic?"

Our prior knowledge is the response of the linear filter.  If the
prior is perfect, then our method will try one grasp and terminate; if
the prior is imperfect, our method will try grasps in order until it
finds a successful one.

"What is the worst case?"

In the worst case, the prior is random, and the robot will need to try
many grasps before it finds a good one.
