We thank the reviewer for their comments on our paper, especially the
survey of related work on grasping.

Yes, during test we reset the object to the reference pose.  Our
method could generalize to new poses by learning a new grasping model
for each of the poses in which the object can rest, up to certain
symmetries such as rotation.

The entire IR scan corresponds to a single frame of a depth camera
image.  We only need this slow scan because we want our approach to
run on a stock Baxter with no additional sensing.
